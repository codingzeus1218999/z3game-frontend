E-commerce store built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS 

## Getting Started

### 1. Configure your local environment

Rename the `.env.local.example` file in this directory to `.env.local` (which will
be ignored by Git):

```
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Add your own values for all the environment variables.

### 2. Start the application

To run your site locally, use:

```
npm run dev
```

To run it in production mode, use:

```
npm run build
npm run start
```
